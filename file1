Hi kishore i have created new file cale "file1" in your repository called "firstgit"
Git is one of the version control system and its distributed vcs
where as svn is centraized version control system, if svn server goes down you it wont be possible to commint changes on your local repositroy.
where as in git , if git goes down althought we can do commit in loca repository, once up git server then we can push code to github.
thats the beauty of distributed version control server
